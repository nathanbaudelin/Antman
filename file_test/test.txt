🎶 Sometimes my life is like an 🌊
And I feel like I'm just going through the motions
My 🤯 is 🏎️ down a 🛣️
I don't know where I'm going, but it's my way 🎶

🎶 That's when I 🛑 trippin'
💭 'bout what I'm missing
I feel so 👍 I might just 🗣️ it again
Just wanna 🛑 trippin'
Thinking 'bout what I'm missing
I feel so 👍 I might just, I might just, I might just 🎶
